# ExpressionTree
A boolean and decimal expression tree implementation with GUI to build and evaluate the tree. This was a solution to a Data structure and algorithms assignment I wrote.

The program shows is in two packages: A regular expression tree using numbers and operators (multiply, divide, subtract and division) or a boolean expression tree using True/False inputs and boolean logic (OR, AND, NOT, XOR)

The program shows a visual representation of the tree from postfix notation it can then convert the formula into infix notation and evaluate the equation.
